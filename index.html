        <h2>The truth is: trading is a get-rich-slow scheme</h2>

        You’re probably thinking: <br />
        “Then what’s the point of being a trader?” <br />
        “No way. I want to make fast money so I can quit my job.” <br />
        “But I’ve heard of traders taking a few thousand dollars and turning it
        into millions.” <br />
        Yes, it’s possible to make big returns from trading in a short period.
        <br />
        How? <br />
        All you need to do is risk all your capital on one trade. <br />
        And if you get a 1-to-1 risk-to-reward ratio, you’ve just doubled your
        account. <br />
        So, what’s the catch? <br />
        It’s not sustainable. <br />
        Because if you encounter a single loss, that’s the end of your account.
        <br />
        So, how should you approach trading? As a get-rich-slow scheme. <br />
        I know it’s not sexy. <br />
        But if you stick with it long enough, it’s possible to grow your account
        to 7-figures (and beyond). <br />
        Here’s how…
        <ul>
          <li>Let’s say you have a $5,000 trading account</li>
          <li>You contribute $5,000 to your account each year</li>
          <li>You earn an average of 20% a year</li>
        </ul>
        Now if you do this consistently for 30 years, do you know how much money
        you’ll have? <br />
        <strong>$8,278,170.</strong>
        <br />
        Yes, you see that right, <strong>$8,278,170.</strong> <br />
        In other words, when you think long-term, the sky is the limit. <br />
        Unfortunately, most traders are fixated on the now that they miss the
        big picture. <br />
        Don’t be one of them.
